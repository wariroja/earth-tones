# Earth Tones

## Introduction
Welcome to the Earth Tones team's project for the TedAI Hackathon! We are excited to harness the transformative power of AI for good and contribute to the community by creating a website that generates music based on mood, serving as a form of music therapy. Our mission is to provide personalized music experiences that help users improve their emotional well-being.

## Project Overview
Music has a profound impact on our emotions and can be a powerful tool for improving mental health and well-being. The Earth Tones project aims to leverage AI to create a unique music generation platform that takes into account a user's personalized listening preferences, current sentiment, and the target mood they want to achieve. The AI model will then generate music that strives to align with the desired mood, providing an uplifting and therapeutic experience for the user.

## Project Description
Our project aims to build a web-based application that offers the following features:
- Sentiment through Journaling: Users can journal their thoughts and feelings, and our AI model will analyze the content to determine their current mood or sentiment.
- Personalized Music Preferences: Users can provide information about their music preferences, such as favorite genres, artists, or instruments.
- Target Mood Selection: Users can specify the mood they want to achieve through the music therapy session.
- AI Music Generation: Our AI model will use the mood analysis, personalized preferences, and target mood to generate music tracks tailored to the user's needs.
- User Feedback: Users can provide feedback on the generated music to improve future sessions.
